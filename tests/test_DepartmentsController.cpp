The "getDepartmentPeople" method for the DepartmentsController provides a GET request to fetch all the personnel within a department. This method uses the "department.getPerson()" method in the PersonService interface and returns an array of Person objects. The result is converted into JSON using "Json::Value", which can be assigned to the "ret" variable as follows:

```c++
auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpJsonResponse(ret);
resp->setStatusCode(HttpStatusCode::k200OK);
```

This sets the HTTP status code to 200 OK and the content type to application/json. This method should only be called when the department's "getPeople" GET method is successfully called, which means that it returns a successful HTTP response from the controller's "createDepartment" method. The final API request can then be generated by combining this method with other ones using standard C++ APIs and conventions (such as passing arguments to methods, adding appropriate headers, etc.).
