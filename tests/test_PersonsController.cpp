The PersonDetails class in the PersonController.js file has a constructor that accepts an object as its parameter, which contains data about the person's details such as ID, full name, and department ID. The class also has methods for getting and setting this data, as well as for converting it to JSON format.

The PersonDetails class has three fields: id, first_name, and last_name (which are all strings), as well as a "manager" field that contains an object with the same keys and values as the PersonInfo object, and a "job" field that contains an object with the same keys and values as the JobInfo object. These fields are used to create/read JSON data from/to the database.

The PersonController.js file has two methods for getting and setting PersonDetails's data:

1. getPersonDetails() retrieves all PersonDetails objects (i.e., it returns an array of them) using AJAX, and assigns each object's id, full name, and department ID to its corresponding fields in the PersonInfo object in the db.

2. setPersonDetails(newObj) takes in a new object as its parameter, assigns it to the PersonDetails fields, and then assigns an array of those objects to PersonInfo. This is used for adding/updating PersonDetails data using AJAX.

The PersonController.js file also includes methods for getting and setting PersonInfo's data:

1. getPersonInfo() retrieves all PersonInfo objects (i.e., it returns an array of them) using AJAX, and assigns each object's ID to its corresponding fields in the PersonDetails object in the db.

2. setPersonInfo(newObj) takes in a new object as its parameter, assigns it to the PersonDetails fields, and then assigns an array of those objects to PersonInfo. This is used for adding/updating PersonInfo data using AJAX.
